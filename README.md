# LibSimTelemDemo
An example project utilizing the LibSimTelem library.

## What does it do?
This program can optionally auto-detect which of the games supported by the [LibSimTelem library](https://github.com/btlanza/LibSimTelem) is running. I've made some simple pixel-style graphics to display the states of the steering wheel rotational position, engine rate, and gas/brake/clutch pedal positions. All of this uses the standard interface, so no game-specific code outside of the library itself is required.
